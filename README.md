# TSP-Knapsack
This project is a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver that utilizes the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique with a knapsack constraint. The goal is to find the shortest path for a salesman to visit a set of points while considering a time constraint.

# Introduction
The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem where a salesman needs to visit a set of cities and return to the starting city, covering the shortest total distance possible. In this project, we employ the ACO technique to solve the TSP while considering an additional knapsack constraint. The knapsack constraint restricts the total time the salesman can spend on the journey.
## Features
ACO-based algorithm to find the shortest path for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
Consideration of a knapsack constraint to limit the total time spent on the journey.
Dynamic visualization of the optimal path on a canvas.
Calculation of the three shortest paths based on the ACO algorithm.
Display of the three shortest paths with their respective distances.
Ability to customize the number of ants and available time.
Interactive user interface with a clear canvas option.

## Installation

1.Clone the repository with command "git clone https://github.com/your-username/tsp-solver-aco-knapsack.git".

2.Open the project directory with Command "cd tsp-solver-aco-knapsack".

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the TSP Solver with ACO and Knapsack:

1. Click on the canvas to add points representing cities or locations.

2. Adjust the number of ants and the available time using the provided inputs.

3. Click the "Start" button to calculate the optimal paths.

4. The canvas will display the shortest path, second shortest path, and third shortest path in different colors.

5. Adjust the time slider to select the desired time constraint.

6. Click the "Find Best Route" button to display the final path considering the knapsack constraint.
